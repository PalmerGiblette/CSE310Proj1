# Overview

{In this program I am showing off some of the skills I have developed while working on learning HTML, and CSS.
Naturally when making other projects, I want to further my own goals to make my own websites}

{The website I wrote was based in HTML, and CSS. This was put in and tesed live on the live test function on Visual Studio Code.}

{Writing code for the website, was for my a personal project. And a good way to test methods of working with HTML, and CSS}
